"""
This module provides two classes that respectively implement a screw and a co-screw.

Exemples
--------
Before using theses objects, you should import the ``geometric_algebra`` module so that you can
create multivectors. For basic physical applications, a three-dimensional should be enough, but you
can use n-dimensional multivectors.

Let's see a minimal exemple::

    >>> import geometric_algebra as ga
    >>> from screw import Screw
    >>> my_algebra = ga.GeometricAlgebra(3)  # a 3-D geometric algebra
    >>> locals().update(my_algebra.blades)   # add the basis blades to the locals (i.e. 1, e1, e2â€¦)
    >>> direction = 2 + (3*e1) + (6*e3)      # creates a MultiVector for the screw's direction
    >>> moment = (2*e1) + (5*e2) + e3        # creates another MultiVector for the screw's moment
    >>> my_screw = Screw(direction, moment)  # finally we create a Screw instance
